              I would have never looked into going abroad during my last year of college if it weren't for your advice. It also 
              helped having someone to talk to that's going through a similar experience but in a different country.

              travelling with you guys made it that much more exciting.

              for this us is inexplainable. From booking all our housing, to planning our trips, to making sure 
              oppertunities were available during covid, you always had us at top priority. Also a slightly added bonus
              having someone that could speak Thai.
